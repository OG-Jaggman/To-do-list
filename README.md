# To-do-list

So, first you want to download all of the files and put them in a folder. You should re-name the "index.html" to something different, BUT KEEP THE ".html" PART IN, e.g: "test.html". Then, click on it and make sure it brings you to the screen that says "My To-Do List". If not, report it to me please.
