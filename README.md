# To-do-list

So, first you want to download all of the files and put them in a folder. When you go into that folder, right-click, then press new>folder, then re-name it to ".vscode". Then, you're going to put the "launch" file inside the folder. Then, you click "index", then it should open the to-do list. If not, report it to me please.
